# Portfolio-Optimization-with-Sharpe-Ratio-Maximization
This project optimizes an ETF portfolio (SPY, BND, GLD, QQQ, VTI) by maximizing the Sharpe Ratio. It uses yfinance to fetch historical adjusted close prices, calculates daily log returns, handles missing data, and computes the annualized covariance matrix of returns for portfolio optimization
